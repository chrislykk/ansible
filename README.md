# Ansible Training Project

This is a personal Ansible training repository designed to practice infrastructure automation concepts using Ansible playbooks, roles, and host-specific variables.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

ansible/
â”œâ”€â”€ site.yml # Main playbook entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory # Inventory file listing target hosts
â”œâ”€â”€ roles/ # Modular Ansible roles
â”œâ”€â”€ host_vars/ # Host-specific variable definitions
â””â”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on your control node (host running the playbook)
- SSH access to the target machines
- Python installed on managed nodes (usually pre-installed)

### Running the Playbook

To execute the main playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
```

ðŸ§± Roles
Each role encapsulates related tasks, handlers, and variables for specific functions. Example:

base: baseline setup for all nodes

web_servers: installs and configures web services

db_servers: installs and configures MariaDB database services

file_servers: installs and configures samba services

ðŸ“„ Host Variables
The host_vars/ directory defines per-host configurations. These override defaults and can be used to tailor deployments to specific machines.
